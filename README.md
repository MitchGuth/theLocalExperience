# The Local Experience
The Local Experience is a web app built in React that uses the Google Maps API and user supplied images and geo-points to create markers on the google map and those markers are saved as experiences. The purpose is to allow users to see mapped points in their area that they can explore and have an experience at that location. For example have you ever taken a walk at lunch and sat at a bench to clear your mind or just breath, if not you should try it. If you have tried it you can upload that expereince on The Local Experience so that other users could have that same moment of rest or recharge and the world can be a better place.

## Anti-Social Social-Media
The Local Experience is in a way an anti-social, social media platform where the content is user driven however there is not room for self glorification as the posts are anonymous. You can however see what experiences you have contributed to the platform to look back on your past experiences and revisit that moment or location as you would a journal entry.
